  title: What On Earth
  description: 'She is in charge of the internal and external affairs of the Kamisato
    Clan and is the younger sister of Kamisato Ayato. Beautiful, dignified, and noble,
    Ayaka has earned the title Shirasagi Himegimi and is considered a model of perfection
    in Inazuma.


    Ayaka is an absolute DPS monster. A very safe playstyle thanks
    to her sprint and a reliable source of Cryo from her Skill, makes her a force
    to be reckoned with.'
